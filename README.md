# Project Showcase

##Introduction
This repository houses several past projects completed during my degree programs at Arizona State University. All files have been included in their original state as they were submitted to their respective professors in an effort to create continuiity between transcipts and physical work. If you are interested in starting a conversation about my work, please contact me through [GitHub](https://github.com/brlacquement) or [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/brandonlacquement/en). You can also find the most current version of my resume in [docx](Resume/Resume2015_FINAL.docx) or [pdf](Resume2015_FINAL.pdf). Below, you will find a summary of notable work for the following technologies: Java, TSQL, C#, Web Dev and Python.

###Web
Below you will find a description for each section of the Web Dev files included in this repo. This work was done in HTML5, CSS3, PHP5, Javascript, MySQL and jQuery. It was written using Notepad++, tested locally with WAMP server, and then transfered via FTP protocol to a web server for live testing. MySQL development was done in phpMyAdmin.

###Python
Below you will find a description for the Python files included in this repo. I am currently working to develop my understanding of Python, as I have not used it in my coursework. This initial file serves as a starting point for SQL scripting. This work was written exclsively in Python on Notepad++. It was tested locally using a MySQL server on WAMP and executed through command prompt with the Python 2.7.9 compiler. This script is new and not yet fully debugged. Expect changes to this section as my understanding of Python devleops.
